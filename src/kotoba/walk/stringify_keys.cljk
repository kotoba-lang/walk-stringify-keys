(defn stringify-keys
  "Recursively transform all keyword map keys in `form` into strings, leaving
  keys of every other type untouched. Mirrors clojure.walk/stringify-keys,
  unbounded.

  Uses `name`, so a namespaced keyword loses its namespace: `:a/b` => `\"b\"`.
  See the section comment above -- that loss is clojure.walk's behaviour and
  is deliberate here.

  `(stringify-keys {:a {:b 1} 2 3}) => {\"a\" {\"b\" 1} 2 3}`"
